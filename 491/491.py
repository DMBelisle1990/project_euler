# There are only 5 possible sums -44, -22, 0, 22, 44
# -22 and -44 probably are the same number of numbers as 22 and 44 so that leaves 3 left to focus on

# Were assigning numbers to 2 arrays, an plus and minus array
# Once a valid assignment is found we take all same size combinations of that array
# 0 has 1 solution
# 44:
# x - y = 44
# x + y = 90
# x = 67, y = 23
# Need to find total possible way to sum 10 numbers to 23
